# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Otman

I used to play with PHP, MySQL and C a long time ago, for fun, with friends, at school,
when games like Travian just started to came out, and I wanted to try to create my own 
browser games and traditional ones.

Fast forwards now, I decided to do web development as a Job rather than a hobby,
seeing people transitioning career through ads on the web, on the street, I got inspired.

Up to that point, I tried to do projects around the web, both front-end and 
back-end, but because I enjoyed mostly working with Node.js & SQL, I lean towards 
back-end development in that ecosystem. I also used PHP again, but with Symfony 
& Laravel at the start of the transition, and I also explored a bit C# with 
.NET Core for console and web app and because I used to play with Unity to make
games.

I'm now an aspiring back-end web developer focused on EcmaScript, TypeScript, 
MySQL, SQLite, Fastify, Express, Google cloud / VPS Platforms, NGinx, Git and more, 
but I also use Angular and Browser technologies. 

I also take enjoyment with C++ discovering low-level concepts of systems, 
memory, cryptography, web servers, and much more.
